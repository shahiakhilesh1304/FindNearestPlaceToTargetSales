# FindNearestPlaceToTargetSales
Find the nearest tageted branch who is eligible to do sales at low cost

I have used geopy module to find the longitude and latitude of the location


This project is basically using KNN Algorithm 
and using the euclidean Distance Formula that is 
A= (x1,y1,z1)
B= (x2,y2,z2)
d = sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2+(z2-z1)^2)
